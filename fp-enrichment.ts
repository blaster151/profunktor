/**
 * fp-enrichment
 * -------------
 * Why this file exists:
 *   Several constructions in Parts 7‚Äì8 of Batanin‚ÄìBerger (e.g., Theorem 8.2 and
 *   Corollary 8.4 on pp. 56‚Äì58 of "Homotopy Theory for Algebras over Polynomial Monads")
 *   require the *ambient* category ùìî to be **enriched in simplicial sets** and to admit
 *   a "good" *realization* functor for simplicial objects. In practice, that means some
 *   high-level derived or homotopical features in our codebase must be **gated** on a
 *   bit of metadata about ùìî. This file provides exactly that metadata + tiny helpers.
 *
 * What developers should know:
 *   ‚Ä¢ Use this when you write code that only makes sense for simplicial enrichment:
 *       - Bousfield‚ÄìKan simplicial replacements;
 *       - Quillen adjunctions that depend on a "good" realization functor |‚Äì|_ùìî;
 *       - Simplicial nerve / classifier constructions (e.g., N(T^S) in Cor. 8.4);
 *       - Any algorithm that relies on a *compatibility relation* like
 *         ùìî_*(X, Y) ‚âÖ ùìî(e, ùìî(X, Y)) (see the discussion leading to Thm. 8.2).
 *   ‚Ä¢ Don't use it for ordinary (plain) category code‚Äîset `enrichment: 'none'`.
 *   ‚Ä¢ For topological enrichment, we keep a placeholder tag ('topological'); the
 *     current algorithms only *require* the simplicial case, but the type allows
 *     future extension.
 *
 * How it maps to the paper:
 *   ‚Ä¢ Theorem 8.2: Under simplicial enrichment + a "good" realization functor and a
 *     standard system of simplices, derived left functors behave well (pointwise
 *     cofibrant replacements compute homotopy colimits, etc.). We expose two boolean
 *     hints to represent those hypotheses:
 *       - `hasStandardSimplices`: encodes "standard system of simplices";
 *       - `hasGoodRealization`: encodes the existence of a "good realization" functor.
 *     Use the guard `supportsGoodRealization(E)` before you trigger algorithms that
 *     assume those hypotheses (e.g., BK simplicial replacement equals hocolim).
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   const E: EnrichedCategory<ModelCategory> = {
 *     base: SetsWithQuillen,
 *     enrichment: 'simplicial',
 *     hasStandardSimplices: true,
 *     hasGoodRealization: true
 *   };
 *
 *   if (isSimplicial(E) && supportsGoodRealization(E)) {
 *     // Safe to run BK-style replacement or collapse nested colimits via Thm. 8.2.
 *     computeHomotopyColimit(diagram, E);
 *   }
 *
 * Minimal policy:
 *   We **never** hard-require these flags at the type level; we only *guard* optional
 *   pathways (optimizations and derived constructions). This keeps the rest of the
 *   library usable for plain categories while making "homotopical" code explicit.
