# Foundations and Capabilities

## Purpose
This document unifies the core conceptual foundations (Unified ADT Definition System and ecosystem pillars) with a pragmatic catalog of what developers and researchers can build using the framework.

---

## Part I — Foundational Concepts (Unified ADT System)

- One-call ADT definition with automatic capabilities: typeclass derivation, fluent API generation, registry integration, optics hooks.
- Purity tagging, law compliance, and integration with recursion schemes and profunctor optics.
- Registry-first design: metadata and capabilities are globally available and composable.

### Quickstart
```typescript
import { defineADT } from './fp-unified-adt-definition';

const Maybe = defineADT("Maybe", {
  Just: (value: any) => ({ value }),
  Nothing: () => ({})
});

const result = Maybe.Just(42).map(x => x + 1);
```

### Configuration Highlights
- Derivation flags: functor, applicative, monad, bifunctor, eq, ord, show
- Purity: 'Pure' | 'Impure' | 'Async'
- Fluent customization and optics enablement
- Automatic global registration of instances and metadata

### Composition Pillars
- Fluent methods + data-last APIs (pipe-friendly)
- Profunctor-based optics (Lens, Prism, Traversal) integrated with HKT/purity
- Usage/Multiplicity tracking hooks designed for streams/optics

---

## Part II — What You Can Build (Capabilities Overview)

### 1) Tangent Categories and Differential Programming
- Automatic differentiation, smooth manifolds, and differential bundles
- Physics simulations with connections, curvature, and geometric flows

### 2) Coalgebras and Recursion Schemes
- State machines and unfolding infinite trees (ana)
- Database query optimization via coalgebraic plans
- Financial modeling with Cofree/Comonadic contexts

### 3) Compact Closed and Span Bicategories
- Quantum circuit design with string diagrams and coherence optimization
- Network protocol design and verification via bicategorical structure
- Resistor network analysis and circuit simplification

### 4) Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT)
- Topological codes, anyonic braiding, quantum-resistant cryptography
- Materials science simulations via topological invariants

### 5) Higher Category Applications
- Software architecture as tricategories; distributed systems via coherence
- ML pipelines as higher categorical compositions

### 6) Developer Tooling
- Type-safe mathematical programming with compile-time verification
- Diagrammatic programming that compiles to executable circuits
- Extensible mathematical library ecosystem (Lawvere theories, axioms, models)

### 7) Research and Discovery
- Automated conjecture generation and theorem discovery
- Unified physical simulations and educational tools

## Part III — Integration Details (Concise)

- Derived instances: replace manual Functor/Applicative/Monad/Bifunctor with configured derivation; standard Eq/Ord/Show via derive* helpers.
- Registry: all instances and purity metadata auto-registered and discoverable.
- Optics: profunctor core with laws; lenses/prisms/traversals with composition utilities.
- Streams/FRP: usage-aware fluent operations; compile-time and runtime safeguards possible.

---

## Part IV — Best Practices
- Prefer single entrypoints and barrels (e.g., data/either, optics/index) for imports.
- Keep purity and law compliance visible; test against law suites.
- Use data-last functions for pipelines; fluent for ergonomics.
- Gate experimental research modules under dedicated namespaces.

## Appendix — Example Patterns

### Product ADTs
```typescript
import { defineProductADT } from './fp-unified-adt-definition';
const Point = defineProductADT("Point", { x: "number", y: "number" });
```

### Custom Derivation
```typescript
const CustomMaybe = defineADT("CustomMaybe", { Just: (v:any)=>({v}), Nothing:()=>({}) }, {
  customMap: (fa, f) => fa.match({ Just: ({v}) => CustomMaybe.Just(f(v)), Nothing: () => CustomMaybe.Nothing() })
});
```
