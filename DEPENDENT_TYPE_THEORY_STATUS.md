## **Next Steps**

Since the Dependent Type Theory implementation is complete and fully functional, the next logical priorities from the CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md are:

### **Option A: Continue SDG Material**
- Pages 79-82 (additional Weil algebra material)
- Extend current SDG implementation

### **Option B: Advanced Mathematical Connections**
- Proof Nets using polynomial functor structure
- Lambda Calculus Models using normal functors
- Homotopy Type Theory connections

### **Option C: Fix Remaining Issues**
- Address the 17 remaining test failures across other modules
- Improve overall project stability

### **Option D: Continue Gambino-Kock Paper**
- Pages 26+ (remaining polynomial functor material)

## **Conclusion**

The Dependent Type Theory implementation represents a **complete and production-ready** system that successfully bridges abstract mathematical theory with practical computation. It provides a solid foundation for advanced type theory applications and serves as a key integration point between the various mathematical systems in the Profunktor library.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**
